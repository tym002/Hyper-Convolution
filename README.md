# Hyper-Convolution Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
Code for our WACV 2022 paper: *Hyper-Convolution Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10559)

Convolutional Kernels are generated by a hyper-network instead of independtly learned

The input to the hyper-network are the spatial coordinates of the kernels

## requirements: 

`tensorflow-gpu 1.15.0`

`python 3.6.13`

## Code:

To initiate training or testing, run:
`python main.py --mode train --config_path config.json`

`--mode = 'train'` for training, `--mode = 'test'` for testing

`--config_path` is the path to config json file that contains all model related config

`kernal.py` contains the input to the hyper-network, which is a two-channels coordinates grid (x and y)

`unet_vanilla.py` contains all the networks including the baseline UNet, non-local UNet and our method
