# Hyper-Convolution Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
Code for our WACV 2022 paper: *Hyper-Convolution Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10559] 

Convolutional Kernels are generated by a hyper-network instead of independtly learned

![alt text](https://github.com/tym002/Hyper-Convolution/blob/main/figure1_architecture.png)

The input to the hyper-network are the spatial coordinates of the kernels

requirements: 

`tensorflow-gpu 1.15.0`

`python 3.6.13`


To initiate training or testing, run:
`python main.py`
In line 14, `mode = 't'` for training

`kernal.py` contains the input to the hyper-network, which is a two-channels coordinates grids (x and y)

`unet_vanilla.py` contains all the networks including the baseline UNet, non-local UNet and our method
